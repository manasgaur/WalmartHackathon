README

Following are the steps to execute the code

1. First execute "Walmart_hacks.py". This file will generate dataset for SVM after performing k_Means clustering
2. Then execute "Walmart_test.py". This file will generate the modified test data for SVM after k_means clustering
3. Finally Execute "Walmart_hacks_SVM.py". This file will generate the predicted output in "shelves_predict.txt" and will list the accuracy, fscore, precision and recall.
4. During the execution of the first program, the first plot that you will see is the "ELBOW plot" for k means for identifying suitable "k" for your data. The decreasing curve shows the elbow. The elbow is the suitable number of clusters for the data.
5. The second plot that your will observe, is the area plot showing the distribution of samples under different clusters.
NOTE : After execute the first program. The generated file is SVM_dataset.csv. open the file and remove the first column which is merely the items id. Similarl, after executing the second program , the generated file is SVM_testset.csv. Remove the first column in this also.
